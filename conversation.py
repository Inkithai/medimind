"""
Conversational Q&A Layer (Phase 2)
=========================================
Builds on retrieval.py's single-shot answer_question() to support real
multi-turn conversations about a patient's medical timeline, without
changing retrieval.py's existing behavior for callers that don't use
sessions.

The core problem this solves: a raw embedding search on a follow-up like
"was that safe with my allergy?" retrieves poorly, because the follow-up
is only meaningful in light of what was said earlier. This module:

    1. Tracks conversation turns per (patient_key, session_id) in a plain
       in-memory ConversationSession.
    2. Rewrites each new question into a self-contained search query
       (using conversation history) before it is embedded/retrieved —
       the raw question is still what's shown to the final answering LLM.
    3. Keeps prompt/token cost bounded via a recent-turns window plus
       periodic summarization of older turns.

Env:
    export GROQ_API_KEY="gsk_..."   (same Groq key used by the rest of the pipeline)

- Resolve pronouns and vague references ("that", "it", "the other one",
  "this medication") into the specific medication/lab/date/event they refer
  to, using the conversation history provided.
- Preserve ALL safety-relevant framing from the original question. If the
  patient is asking about risk, danger, safety, interactions, allergies, or
  dosage, the rewritten query must keep that risk framing explicit (e.g.
  keep words like "safe", "danger", "interact", "allergy") — never rewrite
  it into a neutral factual lookup that loses the risk framing.
- Do not answer the question. Do not add information that isn't implied by
  the conversation.
