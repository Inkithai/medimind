"""
Antidote / poisoning-reference knowledge graph
==============================================
Extracts Section 4 ("Antidotes and other substances used in poisonings")
from a WHO Model List of Essential Medicines PDF and loads it into Neo4j
as a small, literal reference graph:

    (:Medicine)-[:LISTED_IN {dosage_form, list_type, category}]->(:SourceDocument)
    (:Medicine)-[:LISTED_UNDER]->(:AntidoteCategory)

WHO publishes two parallel lists -- the main EML (adults) and the EMLc
(children) -- and they disagree: the adult list carries 15 antidote
entries to the children's 10, and the dosage-form text differs for drugs
in both. So dosage_form / list_type / category are properties of a
*listing* (a medicine within one document), NOT of the medicine itself;
storing them on the node would let whichever PDF was ingested last
silently overwrite the other. Only the drug identity is shared.

Deliberately NOT an LLM extraction: every field is copied verbatim from
a table cell. The source document lists antidote/poisoning-management
drug names and dosage forms, but never states which poison each one
treats -- that pairing is general medical knowledge, not printed text,
so inventing it here (via an LLM or otherwise) would put unverified
medical claims in the graph. Keeping extraction deterministic means
there's nothing to hallucinate.

Usage:
    section = extract_antidote_section("who_eml.pdf")
    ingest_antidote_entries(section, source_document="who_eml.pdf")
    lookup_antidote_references(["naloxone", "ibuprofen"])   # bulk, one round trip
    lookup_antidote_reference("naloxone")                   # single-drug wrapper
