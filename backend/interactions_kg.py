FDA drug-interaction reference — enzyme roles in the knowledge graph
====================================================================
Loads the FDA's "Examples of Drugs that Interact with CYP Enzymes and
Transporter Systems" table into Neo4j:

    (:Medicine)-[:INHIBITS   {strength}]->(:Enzyme)
    (:Medicine)-[:INDUCES    {strength}]->(:Enzyme)
    (:Medicine)-[:METABOLIZED_BY {sensitivity}]->(:Enzyme)
    (:Enzyme {name, kind})                       kind = cyp | transporter
    (:PotencyDefinition)-[:DEFINED_IN]->(:SourceDocument)

WHAT THIS SOURCE DOES AND DOES NOT SAY
--------------------------------------
It does NOT say "drug A interacts with drug B". Not once. It says:

    alfentanil   3A sensitive substrate
    adagrasib    3A strong inhibitor

The interaction between those two exists only when you JOIN them on the
shared enzyme. That join is standard pharmacology and it is exactly what a
graph is good at — but the resulting pair is DERIVED, not quoted, and the
distinction is the whole point of this module.

So derived pairs are never written as edges. There is no
`(:Medicine)-[:INTERACTS_WITH]->(:Medicine)` in this schema, deliberately:
storing one would make an inference indistinguishable from a citation the
moment anyone queried it. Pairs are computed on demand by
`potential_interactions()`, which returns them tagged
`evidence="derived_pharmacokinetic"` and `requires_clinical_review=True`,
carrying the two role statements that WERE quoted so a reader can check the
reasoning.

This matters because a shared-enzyme pair is a POTENTIAL pharmacokinetic
interaction, not a clinically significant one. CYP3A alone has 40 sensitive
substrates and 20 strong inhibitors in this table — 800 theoretical pairs,
most of them clinically unremarkable. Asserting those as cited findings would
bury the real alerts in noise and would launder model-grade inference into
reference-grade evidence, which is the failure the evidence grading in this
repository exists to prevent.

Source is a US Government work (public domain). It is a web page rather than a
PDF, so the retrieved snapshot is archived under reference_sources/ and the
retrieval date is recorded on the source node — a URL alone is not a citation
if the page changes.

Usage:
    python interactions_kg.py --ingest          # parse archived snapshot -> Neo4j
    python interactions_kg.py --refresh         # re-download the snapshot first
    python interactions_kg.py                   # show what is loaded
