"""
Conversational Q&A Layer (Phase 2)
=========================================
Builds on retrieval.py's single-shot answer_question() to support real
multi-turn conversations about a patient's medical timeline, without
changing retrieval.py's existing behavior for callers that don't use
sessions.

The core problem this solves: a raw embedding search on a follow-up like
"was that safe with my allergy?" retrieves poorly, because the follow-up
is only meaningful in light of what was said earlier. Two mechanisms
handle this, in increasing order of reliability:

    1. QUERY REWRITING (LLM) — turns "was that safe?" into a self-contained
       retrieval query. Good at natural language, but it's a model call that
       can fail or drop a detail, so nothing safety-critical depends on it
       alone.

    2. ENTITY FOCUS (deterministic) — the session tracks WHICH medications,
       lab tests and documents the conversation is actually about, resolved
       by exact matching against the patient's own record vocabulary. Focus
       is passed to retrieval so the subject of a follow-up is pinned into
       context as established fact, not re-inferred every turn. This is what
       keeps "what if I take it with this?" anchored even when the LLM
       rewrite fails.

On top of that:

    3. Keeps prompt/token cost bounded via a recent-turns window plus
       periodic summarization of older turns.

Env:
    export LLM_PROVIDER=gemini   (or groq; same provider key used by the rest of the pipeline)
    export GEMINI_API_KEY="AIza..."  (or GROQ_API_KEY="gsk_..." for groq)

  to, using the conversation history and the "currently being discussed"
  entities provided.
- Preserve ALL safety-relevant framing from the original question. If the
  patient is asking about risk, danger, safety, interactions, allergies, or
  dosage, the rewritten query must keep that risk framing explicit (e.g.
  keep words like "safe", "danger", "interact", "allergy") — never rewrite
  it into a neutral factual lookup that loses the risk framing.
- Preserve comparisons across documents or time ("since", "before", "still",
  "changed", "the newer one") — these decide which chunks get retrieved, so
  dropping them silently narrows the answer to a single document.
