Reference Intervals for Common Lab Tests
=========================================
A lookup table of typical reference intervals for the lab tests a patient
most often wants explained, banded by sex and age where that genuinely
changes the interval (hemoglobin, creatinine, ferritin, uric acid, the
transaminases). Used by lab_trends.py to say whether a SINGLE reading --
one with no earlier result to trend against -- sits low, normal or high.

WHY THIS TABLE IS THE FALLBACK, NEVER THE OVERRIDE
--------------------------------------------------
Reference intervals are a property of the assay and the instrument, not of
medicine in general: two labs measuring the same analyte can legitimately
print different ranges. The range printed on the patient's own report is
therefore always more authoritative than anything here, and lab_trends.py
consults this table ONLY when the report printed no range, or printed one
that could not be parsed. Every result interpreted from this table is
labelled as using a general reference interval so nobody reads it as their
own lab's verdict.

WHAT A LOOKUP RESULT MAY AND MAY NOT SAY
----------------------------------------
"Low", "normal" or "high" is a comparison between two numbers, and that is
the entire claim being made. It is not a finding, a cause, or a condition.
The same rule TEST_GLOSSARY in lab_trends.py already follows applies here:
this module describes where a value sits relative to an interval, and never
what sitting there means for the person. That stays a clinician's call.

WHEN NO INTERVAL IS RETURNED
----------------------------
lookup_interval() returns None -- and the caller shows the value with no
status -- whenever:
  - the test is not in this table,
  - the reported unit is not one this module knows how to reconcile with the
    table's unit (a wrong conversion is far worse than no answer),
  - the patient's sex or age is unknown and the matching rule needs it.
Guessing a demographic to force an interval out of this table would produce
a confident status derived from an assumption, which is the one failure
mode this design exists to avoid.

UNITS
-----
Each test declares one canonical unit and the aliases it accepts, with the
factor converting a reported value INTO the canonical unit. Factors are
per-test because molar conversions depend on molecular weight -- glucose
mmol/L -> mg/dL is x18.02, cholesterol is x38.67, triglycerides is x88.57.
A unit not listed for that test is refused rather than assumed.

# `low`/`high` of None means the interval is open on that side: total
# cholesterol has a desirable upper limit and no meaningful lower one, eGFR
# the reverse. Rules are scanned in order and the first match wins, so the
# more specific band goes first.

# Pediatric bands are deliberately sparse. They exist only for the three

# other test a rule starts at 18 and a younger patient simply gets no
