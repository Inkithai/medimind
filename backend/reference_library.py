Clinical Reference Library (citable guidance)
=========================================
Holds published clinical guidance the pipeline can CITE, so a safety finding
can be graded as evidence-backed instead of capped as unverified model recall.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
evidence_grading.py splits findings into `deterministic`, `reference_graph`
and `model_knowledge`, capping the last at 0.6 because nothing in the system
could confirm it. Its own docstring names the gap: the reference graph held
only the WHO antidote list — drug names and dosage forms, no interaction data
— so in practice every interaction and allergy finding graded as unverified.

This module starts closing that gap with the first source that makes a
specific, high-stakes interaction claim in plain terms:

    SAMHSA Overdose Prevention and Response Toolkit (PEP23-03-00-001, 2026)

    "Mixing opioids with alcohol and/or other depressant medications like
     benzodiazepines or tranquilizers can greatly increase the risk of
     overdose."                                                  — page 13

That is exactly the kind of claim the model was previously asserting from
memory at a capped 0.6. Sourced, it can carry its real weight and cite a
page a pharmacist can look up.

WHY NOT A VECTOR STORE
----------------------
retrieval.py documents at length why this codebase has no embeddings index:
the retrieval unit is small and the questions are completeness questions, so
approximate similarity search silently drops evidence that changes an answer.
That reasoning applies here too. This library is a few dozen curated
statements, each already tagged with the drug classes it applies to, so
selecting the relevant ones is an exact lookup over a medication list — not a
nearest-neighbour search. A retrieved-but-wrong passage in a drug-safety
answer is a safety failure, not a relevance miss.

WHAT IS QUOTED VS WHAT IS CLASSIFICATION
----------------------------------------
Same discipline poisoning_kg.py applies to the WHO list: every `quote` below
is copied verbatim from the source with its page number, and nothing is
paraphrased into a stronger claim than the document makes.

The DRUG CLASS LISTS are a different kind of thing and are labelled as such.
The toolkit names some opioids explicitly (page 1) but says only
"benzodiazepines or tranquilizers" as a category — it does not enumerate
them. So the membership lists below are curated drug classification, not
quotations, and `classification_source` marks them. The CLAIM is cited; the
list of which drugs it applies to is ours, and deliberately conservative:
drug classes the source names as depressants, and no further. Sedating
antihistamines, for instance, are excluded — the toolkit never mentions them,
and stretching a citation to cover something it does not say would defeat the
purpose of citing it.
